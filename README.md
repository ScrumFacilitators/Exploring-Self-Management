# Exploring-Self-Management
The game is designed to explore the concept of self-management in Scrum. It focuses on the three accountabilities in Scrum and that of the Leader. By playing the game, players will gain a better understanding of what self-management means and to identify patterns that emerge as they level up into maturity of each accountability.
